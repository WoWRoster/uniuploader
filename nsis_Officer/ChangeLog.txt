UniUploader/Update ChangeLog (in reverse order, newest listed first):

2.7.0.0 Changes:
added - new optional Officer mode system. Allowing 2 UniUploader systems to be setup, 1 for all non-Officers, and likewise the other for Officers. This is to allow GLs (Guild Leaders) to setup Officer-Only Required addons via UniAdmin.
changed - version number is now 2.7.0.0 due to this being a rather hefty system change, along with all the previous 2.6.9.x changes.

2.6.9.4 Changes:
fixed - crash issue when no network access was available, still requires a timer check to auto-detect later but least now no more crashes!
added - guild name custom option to allow GLs (Guild Leaders) to set via UniAdmin an optional Guild Name (or other string) to appear before the UniUploader title area.
added - integration of autoLaunchTimer from update.exe to allow UniAdmin to set how long (in seconds) for the update.exe to auto launch a new UU build.
added - integration of UUTimeOut to allow UniAdmin to set how long for UU to timeout from lack of connection or broken URLs, etc.
added - update.exe now uses custom autoLaunchTimer option stored from UU and set via UA.
added - UU will now also download and update a ChangeLog.txt file for those wishing to keep track of the changes.
